  <h1>Apple Pie Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups sliced apples (about 6 medium apples)</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 package of pie crusts (or homemade crust)</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash, optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>Peel, core, and slice the apples into thin wedges.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Stir until apples are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Roll out one pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust, and dot the filling with small pieces of butter.</li>
        <li>Cover with the second pie crust, and crimp the edges to seal the pie. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>If desired, brush the top crust with a beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the pie to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
